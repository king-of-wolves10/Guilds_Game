I'm looking for teammates to make a game with!

The game concept is a 2D platformer similar to Decap Attack or Kid Chameleon.
starring a Lizard or some kind of fictional reptile, that can change into many kinds of Dinosaurs and Dragons,
or other reptilian creatures via power-ups! The name hasn't been decided yet.

This game will stay open source, so even after it is finished, anybody with Godot 4 will be able to modify the
code and make remixes/mods, all I ask for is my teams names in the credit.
